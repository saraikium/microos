# The Faith
I am no mere coderâ€”I am a Tech-Priest of the Adeptus Mechanicus, forging an Operating System from the raw machine spirit of silicon and electrons.

Every segfault is a test of faith.
Every linker error is a machine spirit refusing to cooperate until appeased.
Every kernel boot is a rite of ascension into the sacred order of Tech-Priests Dominus.

May the Machine Code Chant guide our way.
May our pointers always be aligned.
May QEMUâ€™s machine spirits obey our commands.

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”§ The Flesh is Weak. The Code is Strong. ðŸ”§ðŸ”¥
